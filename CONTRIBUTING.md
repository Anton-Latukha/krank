## Design guidelines

When designing a rule, we want to follow some guidelines:

- Be as language agnostic as possible. We look for plain text in comment and if possible we will
  parse the full text without any logic to separate comment from code.
- Be as simple as possible. The less custom markers, the better.
- We can be opiniated if needed. That's better to have a simple rule with an opiniated choice than a
  complex rule aiming at matching all the use case of the universe.
